# Planning

Budgeting & related commitments

* Operating budget \(Aug - Nov\)
* Capital budget \(Jan - Mar -ish\)
* Capital budget approval \(spring-ish\)
* Operating budget approval \(June / July\)

Fiscal year & external commitments

* July 1 through June 30
* Goals and milestones determined through budgeting process

Secretary

* Try, test, iterate
* Leave enough runway for iterating that we can make good on external commitments on time and on value
* 6-12 month priorities
* Deliver value quarterly
* Build on successes

Project teams

* Cross-functional staffing, priorities, DS commitments determined or \(re\)evaluated quarterly
* Teams are self-organizing, here are a few standard practices across teams
  * Jira
  * Most practice some version of agile and demo every 2 weeks
  * All have a named project manager who takes responsibility for setting stakeholders' expectations before work begins with a written SOW, reporting back to stakeholders \(and adjusting expectations if necessary\) at a mid-quarter review, and reporting back on the SOW at the end of the quarter
* Best practices
  * Allocate people 100% to a single team \(in rare circumstances 2 teams\)
  * Keep teams together for at least a quarter \(there's a cost to reorganizing, storming, forming, norming tends to take ~6 weeks\), many prefer longer
  * Maximize cross-functional capabilities by staffing teams to be independent, autonomous, and self-sufficient
  * Learn, assess, and \(re\)evaluate roadmap, approach, and team composition quarterly to find best path to reaching yearly goals
